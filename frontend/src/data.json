At the top end, you can find plenty of luxury hotels along the beaches of Zona Sul, the city's southern zone, which includes the renowned Copacabana and Ipanema beaches. For something to suit a budget, but with good beach access, look around the less crowded neighborhoods of Catele and Flamengo. If you want to stay as centrally as possible, without feeling like you're in a business district, look for lodgings in the colorful, bohemian neighborhood of Santa Teresa.",
